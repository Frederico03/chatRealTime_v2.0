# CHAT REAL TIME # 
 
This is my first major project using C#. In this project, I refactored an entire backend that was originally developed with Node.js. I replaced Socket.io with SignalR for WebSocket communication. Additionally, I utilized tools like MongoDB.Driver and MongoDB.EntityFrameworkCore to interact with MongoDB. The frontend is built using React.
